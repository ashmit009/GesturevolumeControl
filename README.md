Gesture Volume Control

Developed a cross-platform hand gesture recognition system for controlling system volume using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Implemented real-time video processing to detect hand landmarks and map finger movements to volume adjustments.
Created a dynamic volume bar display in the OpenCV window to visually represent the current volume level.
Utilized the pycaw library for Windows and osascript for macOS to interface with system audio controls.
Achieved smooth and responsive volume control through interpolation of hand gesture distances.
Enhanced user experience with real-time feedback and visual cues for effective volume management.
